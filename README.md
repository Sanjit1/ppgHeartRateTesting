# ppgHeartRateTesting
 This repo will contain some of my testing for PPG Heart Rate stuff

This is a really rough overview, I will make a different repo for the actual code later.

In the public folder, there are two folders: pretrained and semantic_segmentation. These were taken from [WillBrennan/SemanticSegmentation](https://github.com/WillBrennan/SemanticSegmentation). These will be gitignored(yea I'm still keeping them in public)
